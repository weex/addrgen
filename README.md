## addrgen - minimal Bitcoin address generator in Python

This script generates a single Bitcoin address using the compressed public key format and prints it with its private key.

### Usage 

    python addrgen.py

### Mac OS X

For some reason, the script segfaults on OS X unless it's run in in 32-bit mode. Instead, those on OS X should run:

    bash addrgen.sh

or run a compatible python version if you have troubles with bash script above:

    arch -32 /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python addrgen.py 

### Generating other types of addresses

Supply the version number for your desired address  with the --otherversion switch. (supported by pywallet at least)

    python addrgen.py --otherversion=48

If you wish to generate addresses based on a passphrase, a given private key, or some other option look at the commented lines in the test() function.
